# Fashionably-Late
Fashionably Late is a 4-player party game wherein everyone's goal is to arrive in second place. The game art will be in low-poly 3D, with movement and player position based on a game board. Players can pickup abilities along the way to boost, stall or cause other effects on themselves or any other player.

We want to achieve a balance of skill, luck, and sabotage. Players should feel that skill is useful, but not a guaranteed victory. New players should have opportunities to win. Players should also be able to focus on sabotaging others, but not to the degree where real life fights might break out.
